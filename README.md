# encrypting-and-decrypting
Group Project for Obj Oriented Programming IT 
Description: This program will ask the user for a message and then randomly encrypt and decrypt it using one of six cyphers. The program will then display to the user the encrypted and decrypted messages along with the cipher chosen. It'll indefinitly repeat until the user types in "stop", in which it'll show all encrypted and decrypted messages along with the ciphers used for each message.

For productEncrypt
Due to the nature of this cipher there might be some ascii characters that are not visible or represented on online IDE's.
However, it still encrypts and decrypts the message.
